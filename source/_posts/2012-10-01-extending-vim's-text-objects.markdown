I made a youtube video explaining how I extend vim's text objects (e.g. `ci"`, `daw`, `yi<`, etc.) to allow `ci|`, `da.`, and `yi:`. I've also found `ci*` and `ci_` helpful for editing markdown bold and italics and `/` and `\` valuable for directories and LaTeX.

I've changed my [vimrc](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rsx0su1cravnjip/vimrc) to reflect this.
