I've been wanting to do a series of vim tutorials for a while, but it seems like there's already so many resources out there that would be better than anything I could put together. A while back I was watching a ["Let's Play"][lets] on YouTube and I thought, "Hey, that could work for a vim tutorial of the help documents." After sort of chuckling at the idea as being possibly one of the most boring ideas ever I decided that if someone else did it I might actually watch it, so why not make it? I've been really busy this semester and don't have a lot of free time to make great content, but this is a fun, simple, casual way to learn more about my favorite text editor and an attempt at contributing back to the vim community. Hopefully people trying to understand the documentation will find this series helpful (provided I ever finish it). All that being said, I present to you the first couple episodes of "Let's Read Vim :help".
