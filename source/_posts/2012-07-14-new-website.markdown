Well, just to make things more confusing, I've changed my website again. [Wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) just wasn't cutting it for me and I had already purchased an [Amazon EC2 Instance][ec2] for 3 years out. I've now registered this domain name for another 3 years as well, so this should be a semi-permanent move. I also changed from using wordpress to using [octopress][], a [jekyll][] spinoff. It's pretty involved, but it has the customization and end-level simplicity I've been looking for. During this transition period I haven't really been able to write much, but I will soon. For the tech subscribers, I'll let you know about my octopress transition shortly, and for the friends and family, I'll let you know how my summer was as soon as I'm able. If you're subscribed via email then you don't need to do anything. If you've saved a bookmark for my site then you'll need to make new bookmarks. If you're subscribed via RSS then you'll need to subscribe to the new RSS feeds found [here](/subscribe). Hope this worked... cheers!
