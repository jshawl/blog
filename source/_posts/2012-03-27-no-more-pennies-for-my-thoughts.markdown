I got an email last week that I was due for a payment on my website. Unfortunately, I can't afford to keep this running anymore, so I'm moving my website to a free option on wordpress.com. For most of you, this will have no impact on the emails you receive. However, if you have a bookmark or shortcut to my site you'll need to change it to connermcd.wordpress.com instead of connermcd.com. If you use my RSS feeds you'll also need to change any link with connermcd.com in it to connermcd.wordpress.com.
Other than that most things should operate relatively the same. Wordpress.com doesn't allow the use of different plugins that were allowing me to do some cool things like colorize my code, embed videos, use PHP to run scripts, edit CSS and javascript files (and thus jQuery), and host my mp3 music files. Because of this I've had to edit or remove some of my old posts that used these features, but if you have no idea what I'm talking about then it probably won't affect you.
